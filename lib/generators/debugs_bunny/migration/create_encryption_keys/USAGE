Description:
    Generates a migration for defining a debug trace table. The migration complements the debug trace model. The
    migration can be performed by invoking rails db:migrate. Once the migration is performed, subclasses of the Trace
    model can be instantiated and saved to the application's database.

Example:
    rails generate debugs_bunny:migration --table_name debug_traces

    This will create:
        app/models/debug_traces.rb
